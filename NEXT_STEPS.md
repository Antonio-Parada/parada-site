<!-- Update the form in create-blog.md -->
<form name="blog-signup" method="POST" netlify>
  <!-- existing form fields -->
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="blog-signup" />
</form>
```

#### Manual Blog Creation Script
```powershell
# Create simple PowerShell script
.\create-user-blog.ps1 -Username "newuser" -Email "user@email.com" -Title "New User's Blog"

## üìã Week-by-Week Breakdown

### This Week (Week 1)
- [ ] Test all current functionality
- [ ] Choose backend approach (Netlify recommended)
- [ ] Set up basic form submission
- [ ] Document manual blog creation process

### Next Week (Week 2)  
- [ ] Implement chosen backend
- [ ] Create first manual user blog
- [ ] Test complete user journey
- [ ] Write user onboarding email template

### Week 3
- [ ] Create 3-5 demo user blogs

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Form submissions work (email notifications)
- [ ] Manual blog creation process is documented
- [ ] 5+ demo user blogs created successfully
- [ ] Process takes <30 minutes per new blog
- [ ] Users receive clear confirmation and instructions

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

### Keep It Simple:
- No complex automation initially
- Manual processes are okay for first 20-50 users
- Focus on user experience over technical complexity
- Always have fallback options

### Avoid Over-Engineering:
- Don't build complex user dashboards yet
- Don't automate everything immediately
- Don't create GitHub dependencies
- Don't optimize prematurely

## üí° Key Principle

> **Start with humans, automate gradually**
> 
> Manual processes allow you to:
> - Learn what users really need
> - Provide personalized onboarding
> - Catch issues early
> - Build community relationships

## üöÄ Immediate Action Items

1. **Today**: Test all platform URLs thoroughly
2. **This Week**: Choose and implement basic form backend
3. **Next Week**: Create first manual user blog
4. **Week 3**: Scale to 5-10 user blogs
5. **Week 4**: Build basic automation

This approach ensures sustainable growth without over-leveraging any platform or creating complex dependencies.
