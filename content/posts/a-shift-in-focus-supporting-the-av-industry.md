## A New Focus: From Production to Support

For many years, my career has been deeply rooted in the world of professional audio-visual production. I've had the privilege of working on incredible projects and telling stories through a variety of mediums. However, I'm excited to announce a shift in my professional focus.

While I still love the creative process, I'm transitioning my career to support the industry from a different angle. My goal is to leverage my experience to build tools and systems that help creatives and production houses work more efficiently.

### Current Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently developing:

*   **[Productiontools.io](https://productiontools.io):** This site hosts a collection of essential tools for audio-visual editing and production. You'll find resources like LUT formation and transformation tools, scripts for popular audio-visual and 3D applications, and a variety of other assets designed to streamline your workflow.
    *   **Project Manifest:** To provide accessible, powerful, and easy-to-use tools that empower audio-visual creators to solve technical challenges and focus on what they do best: creating.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **LUT Toolkit:** Create, convert, and apply color lookup tables (LUTs) to your footage for quick and consistent color grading.
        *   **Script Library:** Access a growing collection of scripts for automating tasks in common audio-visual editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve) and 3D applications (e.g., Blender, Cinema 4D).
        *   **Asset Hub:** Download stock footage, sound effects, and other production-ready assets.
    *   **Potential Future Features:** Based on user feedback, I may explore:
        *   A community-driven section for user-submitted scripts and tools.
        *   Direct integration with cloud storage providers for asset management.
        *   An expanded library of advanced color grading and VFX tools.

*   **[dropedit.com](https://dropedit.com):** Dropedit offers a secure and cost-effective solution for post-production. Simply drop off your drives from a recent shoot, and they are automatically backed up and synced to the cloud. You can then edit your project using a secure, high-performance editing environment. This service is designed to cut down on editing costs and provide peace of mind for editors, directors, DPs, and other production stakeholders.
    *   **Project Manifest:** To simplify post-production logistics by offering a secure, automated, and affordable "data-to-edit" pipeline, giving production teams peace of mind and more time for creativity.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **Automated Backups:** Your physical drives are backed up to multiple locations, including the cloud, ensuring data redundancy and security.
        *   **Cloud Syncing:** Access your footage from anywhere with an internet connection.
        *   **Secure Remote Editing:** Edit your projects on a high-performance virtual machine, pre-configured with the latest editing software.
    *   **Potential Future Features:** Based on user feedback, I may explore:
        *   AI-powered services for automatic transcription and footage logging.
        *   Real-time collaborative editing features for remote teams.
        *   A mobile app for tracking backup progress and project status.

*   **gig-me:** This is a creative-first platform where professionals can list their services and equipment. It allows creatives to build out detailed packages and day rates based on factors like distance, equipment, services, and hours. The focus is on putting the creative first, enabling talent searches and clients to accurately find each other and agree on flexible, transparent pricing.
    *   **Project Manifest:** To build a marketplace that puts creative professionals first, fostering transparent and fair connections between talent and clients, and empowering creatives to build sustainable careers.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **Creative-First Profiles:** Build a profile that showcases your skills, experience, and unique creative voice.
        *   **Flexible Service Packages:** Create custom packages and day rates based on your services, equipment, and location.
        *   **Advanced Search:** Clients can find the right talent based on their specific needs, including location, skills, and equipment.
    *   **Potential Future Features:** Based on user feedback, I may explore:
        *   Integrated and secure payment processing.
        *   A robust reputation and review system.
        *   Built-in calendar and availability management.
        *   Direct messaging and contract generation tools.

I'm incredibly excited about this new chapter and the opportunity to contribute to the industry in a new way. Stay tuned for more updates!
