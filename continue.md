# Multi-Tenant Blog Platform Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Goal
Create a multi-tenant blogging platform where users can have their own blogs at `blog.mypp.site/username`, starting with your blog at `blog.mypp.site/parada`.

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ Created frontend components (Create Blog page, forms, styling)
- ✅ Built backend API simulation scripts
- ✅ Developed deployment and project tracking tools
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: GitHub Pages integration for multi-tenant hosting

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: GitHub Pages Multi-Tenant Setup ⏳ CURRENT
**Goal**: Get `blog.mypp.site/parada` working as your main blog

#### Step 1.1: DNS Configuration ✅ DONE
- [x] Configure Namecheap DNS for `blog.mypp.site`
- [x] Set CNAME record pointing to GitHub Pages

#### Step 1.2: Repository Structure for Multi-Tenant 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Modify Hugo config for multi-tenant base URLs
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow for proper deployment
- [ ] Test deployment with `/parada` path
- [ ] Verify DNS resolution and HTTPS

#### Step 1.3: Production Validation
- [ ] Test `blog.mypp.site/parada` resolves correctly
- [ ] Verify all links work with the new structure
- [ ] Confirm GitHub Pages deployment is successful
- [ ] Test SSL certificate is working

### Phase 2: Lightweight Backend (Conservative Approach)
**Goal**: Create simple, sustainable backend without over-leveraging GitHub

#### Step 2.1: Simple External Backend
- [ ] Evaluate lightweight hosting options (Netlify Functions, Vercel, simple VPS)
- [ ] Create minimal user registration form handler
- [ ] Implement basic email collection and validation
- [ ] Set up simple database (JSON file or lightweight DB)

#### Step 2.2: Manual Blog Creation Process (Initially)
- [ ] Create template for new user blogs
- [ ] Document manual process for adding new users
- [ ] Build simple admin script for user management
- [ ] Avoid complex GitHub automation initially

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Polish and enhance the platform

#### Step 3.1: User Experience
- [ ] Add real-time username availability checking
- [ ] Implement theme preview system
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow
- [ ] Add blog templates and starter content

#### Step 3.2: Platform Management
- [ ] Admin dashboard for platform management
- [ ] User usage analytics
- [ ] Content moderation tools
- [ ] Backup and recovery systems
